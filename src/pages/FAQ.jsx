          answer: 'Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) define: Who is responsible for shipping costs, Risk transfer points between buyer and seller, Insurance responsibilities, Customs clearance obligations.

        },
        {
          question: 'What is the difference between FOB and CIF?',
          answer: 'FOB (Free On Board): Seller delivers goods on board the vessel, buyer pays for main carriage and insurance, risk transfers when goods cross ship\'s rail.

        },
        {
          question: 'Which Incoterm should I choose?',
          answer: 'Choice depends on: Your experience with international trade, Control desired over logistics, Risk tolerance, Cost considerations. Beginners often prefer CIF/CIP (seller handles more), experienced traders may choose FOB/FCA for better control and potentially lower costs.'

        },
        {

        },
        {
          question: 'When should I use FCL vs LCL?',
          answer: 'Use FCL (Full Container Load) when: You have enough cargo to fill most of a container, Need faster transit times, Shipping fragile/valuable goods, Want better control over handling. Use LCL (Less than Container Load) when: Cargo volume is small, Cost is primary concern, Flexible on timing.'

          question: 'What are container weight limits?',
          answer: 'Standard weight limits: 20ft container: Max gross weight 24,000 kg (payload ~21,600 kg), 40ft container: Max gross weight 30,480 kg (payload ~26,680 kg).
